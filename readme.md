# Snack Array Methods

## Description

### SNACK 1

Dwayne Johnson asked us to create place cards for the guests' table at his mega VIP party.
He left us the name of the table ("VIP Table") and the list of guests in seating order:
[ 'Brad Pitt', 'Johnny Depp', 'Lady Gaga', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Georgina Rodriguez', 'Chiara Ferragni', 'Fedez', 'George Clooney', 'Amal Clooney', 'Maneskin']
But in order to print everything, the printer wants us to send them a list of guests in a specific format, so we have to make sure that each guest is a javascript object that has the following attributes:
table name, (tableName)
guest name, (guestName)
seat occupied. (place)
We generate and print the list for the placeholders in the console.

### SNACK 2

We have a list of students of a faculty, identified by id, Name and total sum of their exam marks...
1. To prepare the classroom for a new course, we need to print the plates with the students' names: create a list containing their names in capital letters
ES (Marco della Rovere => MARCO DELLA ROVERE);
2. We need to create a list of all students who have a total grade above 70
3. We need to create a list of all students who have a total grade above 70 and an id above 120
